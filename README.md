# WeatherProject

This project takes as input the location where you want to find out the weather information (temperature, days of the week, weather type, precipitation, humidity, wind and a link to the location on Google maps). It parses data from the Chrome browser and displays it in the console. All this data is also recorded in the Sqlite3 database. You can see the recorded data in the database for all runs. You can also clear the database at the end of the program output.
